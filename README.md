# Where's Wookiee?
A twist on the classic game we all know and love 

--- 

In this game, you are prompted to find all 5 characters in under 1min 30 sec. The quicker you find the characters, the more bonus points you recieve. 

Please note, that since this isn't hosted, there will be no leaderboard to show on the last pop-up modal. 

## Technology Used 

This is a single page application build using a vanilla JS frontend with Bootstrap styling and a Rails API [backend](https://github.com/ashleymader/wheres_wookiee_backend)  for scorekeeping.
